NLEConverter
============

Parser for export of Nitro Level Editor to Andengine default XML format for level creation.

Some time ago I created this simple parser for easier transfer from levels created in NLE and exported in XML format,
to be parsed with this simple program and converted to Andengine format. 
The project itself is also a Netbeans project (https://netbeans.org/) :)
